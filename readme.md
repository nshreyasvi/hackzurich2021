# Usage Instructions
## Using Multi-polyfit-models for predicting life for a specific section of train tracks 
Filtered out dataset from the original dataset can be downloaded by cloning this repository and a simple web UI can be launched to show a simple demo for the given project. There are still some variables that have not been considered yet to find life of train tracks that would improve the accuracy further. Moreover, we still need to run a few trial-and-error steps to find best parameters to have accurate predictions.
